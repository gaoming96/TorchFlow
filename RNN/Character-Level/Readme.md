# Pytorch RNN

Please see the homepage for description.

`char_rnn_generation_tutorial.py` is the runnable pytorch official tutorial. However, I can't understand it's RNN structure.

`char_rnn_generation.py` is my try, using `torch.nn.RNN`, but it is not trained at all.

( I find one mistake is that I forget to concate language vector to the input. However, even I fix it, the model still not learned).
