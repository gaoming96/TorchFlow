# Exercise: Augmenting the LSTM part-of-speech tagger with character-level features
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# In the example above, each word had an embedding, which served as the
# inputs to our sequence model. Let's augment the word embeddings with a
# representation derived from the characters of the word. We expect that
# this should help significantly, since character-level information like
# affixes have a large bearing on part-of-speech. For example, words with
# the affix *-ly* are almost always tagged as adverbs in English.
#
# To do this, let :math:`c_w` be the character-level representation of
# word :math:`w`. Let :math:`x_w` be the word embedding as before. Then
# the input to our sequence model is the concatenation of :math:`x_w` and
# :math:`c_w`. So if :math:`x_w` has dimension 5, and :math:`c_w`
# dimension 3, then our LSTM should accept an input of dimension 8.
#
# To get the character level representation, do an LSTM over the
# characters of a word, and let :math:`c_w` be the final hidden state of
# this LSTM. Hints:
#
# * There are going to be two LSTM's in your new model.
#   The original one that outputs POS tag scores, and the new one that
#   outputs a character-level representation of each word.
# * To do a sequence model over characters, you will have to embed characters.
#   The character embeddings will be the input to the character LSTM.
